                      =A CHEATER'S QUICKIE FAQ=


Access all the cheats by pressing :
Alt  Ctrl  Shift  C

This should bring up a small column to type in anything.
Well, just type in the following to get strange effects.

PLEASE NOTE : The cheats are not 100% confirmed to work for
all versions. They may be case sensitive also, so if nothing
works then try again !

i am weak
<You won't pay a cent to re-do terrain or build roads with
this one ! The only thing stops your way is removing trees,
they still cost money.>

power to the masses
<Pretty obvious that this a cheat for power supply. It will
grant excess to all possible power plants no matter what time
zone you are playing in. Example, Microwave Power Station in 1900
is really impossible unless you've cheated !>

water in the desert
<Like the above code, this will grant all possible Water
structures in any timezone.>

garbage in, garbage out
<This grants all garbage buildings, no matter what timezone.>

call cousin Vinnie
<It's a one time offer. You type this and access your
"Meet" option at the screen's toolbar. You should then meet
up with a fishy looking guy that's got cash for you
- $100,000 if you accept his offer !

However, judging from a good mayor's point of view ...
it's corruption ! You take the pick, and if you don't
accept the deal, then type the following cheat ....>

zyxwvu
<This will only work if Vinnie gets rejected ! You will get a 
reward of a castle in your "Rewards" option on the toolbar.>

Salt on / Salt off
<This determines if your seawater or any other water source
will be fresh water or salt water in nature. This helps to
reduce cost for destillation of the salt water.>

i love red tape
<Notice that if you "Query" the City Hall, it has a
"miles of red tape" listing.>
